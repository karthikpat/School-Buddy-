School Buddy is an innovative startup designed to help students identify the best schools based on their preferred streams—Arts, Science, and Commerce. It provides personalized school recommendations by analyzing student performance across three consecutive years. The platform recognizes top performers in each school based on cumulative marks, ranks students within their institutions, and compares the marks of Rank 10 students across different schools. Additionally, it tracks subject-wise improvements, identifies the best schools for each stream, and categorizes students into five performance levels ranging from Very Poor to Very Good. School Buddy also determines the top-performing schools annually based on the highest number of students in the "Good" and "Very Good" categories and identifies the fastest-growing school in Bangalore both overall and stream-wise.

Targeting students, parents, schools, and EdTech companies, School Buddy offers valuable insights for school selection and academic benchmarking. Its business model revolves around subscription-based premium analytics for schools, paid data insights for curriculum improvements, partnerships with educational institutions, and monetization through advertisements and sponsorships. Investors should consider School Buddy due to its data-driven decision-making approach, AI-driven analytics, and strong growth potential in the EdTech market. With increasing demand for informed school selection, School Buddy presents a scalable solution with multiple revenue streams, making it a promising investment opportunity.

## Problem Statements
1. Reward the top performer (student) of each school based on cumulative marks scored in last three years for all the subjects
2. Rank each student within their own school based on their total marks scored in the year 2020 and compare the marks of Rank 10 for each school by arranging them in descending order
3. Find out students with the highest improvement for each subject from 2019-21 combining all the schools together
4. Identify best school for Arts, Science and Commerce streams based on marks scored by students in respective subjects for those streams in last three years
5. If the marks obtained for each subject can be categorised under 5 sections like below:
    
    <=20 - Very Poor
    
    >20 - <=40 - Poor
    
    >40 - <=60 - Average
    
    >60 - <=80 - Good
    
    >80 - <=100 - Very Good
    

Then calculate for each school how many students were in each category based on the avg. marks obtained each year

6)  Which is the best school for each year 2019, 2020 and 2021 based on highest no. of students in Good and Very Good category

7)  Which is the fastest-growing School in Bangalore (Overall and Streamwise)?
